						<h5><strong>MORNING</strong> APPLICATION</h5>
						<p>Scarology® Ultimate Scar Care System is a simple day and night routine designed to improve the overall colour, texture and appearance of scars to achieve what can be dramatic results. The exfoliator is a key step because exfoliation allows the removal of the unhealthy skin cells overlying the scar, stimulates the healthy surrounding tissue to replicate and replaces the top layer of skin. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="services-item services-item--evening">
						<div class="services-step">2</div>
						<h5><strong>EVENING</strong> APPLICATION</h5>
						<p>For the best results, we recommend applying the Ultimate Scar Cream twice a day. Taking a few minutes in the evening to reapply the Ultimate Scar Cream will support the renewal of your skin throughout the night. Complete this step prior to the application of the Silicone Scar Sheets at bedtime.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-4">
					<div class="services-item services-item--night" >
						<div class="services-step">3</div>
						<h5><strong>NIGHT</strong> APPLICATION</h5>
						<p>The Silicone Scar Sheets can provide the compression and nourishment needed for your scar to heal throughout the night. Take a quick minute to apply the self-adhesive sheet to your dry scar prior to going to bed. The scar sheets are both flexible and comfortable so you won’t even notice it’s there.

								<div class="panel-body">
								<p>Scarology was created by Dr. Michael Connor and Dr. Jeanmarie Connor because the commercially available scar treatment products they were recommending to their patients did not convincingly show any improvement in the appearance of scars. Scarology’s complete scar treatment system is different than any scar treatment products available on the market today, many of which have been shown in scientific studies to have little to no benefit.   Scarology is an innovation in scar treatment combining exfoliation, a scar cream and silicone sheets all within a simple day and night routine.</p>

								<p>No other scar treatment has incorporated a gentle exfoliation step to aid in the prevention of new scars and in remodeling old scars.  Exfoliation procedures such as dermabrasion or laser resurfacing have been shown to be effective in improving the appearance of a scar but can cost thousands of dollars with the possibility of significant down time.  Scarology’s Natural Fruit Acid Skin Exfoliator works on the scar over time and is easily incorporated into your daily routine.  </p>   

								<p>Scarology’s proprietary scar cream was formulated after extensive research of the medical literature.  The goal was to create a scar cream with natural ingredients and to avoid using ingredients that have been scientifically shown to have little or no benefit, such as onion extract.  Some of the ingredients, until now, have only been available in medical settings and are not currently in any other over the counter scar creams.  These key ingredients have been shown to nourish the healing scar with hydration, boost the immune system, and reduce inflammation in the scar tissue*. </p>
