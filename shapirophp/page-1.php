                        <h3>Phases of Hair Loss</h3>
						<ol class="ol-list">
							<li>Testosterone enters the hair follicle cells through gateways known as androgen receptors. Inside the cell Testosterone undergoes enzymatic reactions. A byproduct of this process, Di-Hydro Testosterone (DHT) is the root cause of shedding and thinning hair.</li>
                            <li>The enzyme 5-alpha reductase (5AR) is present within the hair follicle cells. This enzyme is responsible for converting testosterone to DHT.</li>
                            <li>DHT interacts with the DNA of the hair follicle cells, activates the hair loss genes and inhibits normal hair growth.</li>
                            <li>Hair production slows, the hair follicles atrophy and produce finer, thinner hairs. Eventually over time the hair production stops completely and the hair follicles die.</li>

 					<div class="behind-step__item">
 						<h3>FIGHTS DHT</h3>
 						<p>Hair loss is typically caused by excess 
						<strong>dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</strong> in the body. 
						Shapiro MD active ingredients target the specific enzyme that converts the male hormone testosterone into <strong>DHT</strong>, effectively halting the main cause of hair loss.</p>
 					</div>
 					<div class="behind-step__item">
 						<h3>FOR MEN &amp; WOMEN</h3>
 						<p>Our products are designed to treat hair loss and thinning hair in both men and women.  <strong>DHT</strong> is the main culprit for thinning hair in women.  <strong>Blocking DHT using Shapiro MD’s</strong> advanced formulation is the most reliable way to stop hair loss and regain thicker hair.</p>
 					</div>
 					<div class="behind-step__item">
 						<h3>THICKER, FULLER HAIR</h3>
 						<p>Our Triple Action shampoo and conditioner has helped thousands of men and women achieve life changing thicker and fuller looking hair.  In addition to powerful <strong>DHT blockers, Shapiro MD’s</strong> products contain essential nutrients for a healthy scalp and hair.</p>
 					</div>
