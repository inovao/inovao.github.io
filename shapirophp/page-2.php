							<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #726272;"><strong>Recommended routine:</strong> Use Shapiro MD Shampoo and Conditioner every day if possible. Use the Shampoo and Conditioner every day. If you shower in the morning, apply the Shapiro MD Foamer at night for 24 hour DHT blocking. Apply the 5% minoxidil after your shower (not before!) to help stimulate new hair growth and restore the missing hair to your bald areas. For fastest results, we recommend leaving the shampoo in for at least 5 minutes (20 minutes max) after applying it, typically before you get in the shower. </p>

This patented formula is designed for use

by men and women of all hair types. For best results, use with the Shapiro MD Conditioner and Daily Leave-In Foam. Noticeable improvement in hair health and appearance may be seen after only a few uses. Individual results may vary. </p>

2 to 5 minutes or longer if desired. Rinse. Allow at least 2-3 months of daily use for noticeable results. Continue use thereafter. Avoid contact with eyes. </p>



             <p style="font-size: 14px; color: #E0393C;"><strong> HEALTH WARNING:</strong> Not for use by women of childbearing age, women who are pregnant, may become pregnant,

or breast feeding, because of potential hormonal risk on an unborn or nursing child. Please check with your physician if you have sensitivity to any ingredient of this shampoo.

				<div class="accordion">

					<div class="accordion__item">

						<div class="accordion__head"><h3>What makes this product so good?</h3></div>

						<div class="accordion__body">

							<p>Shapiro MD products have received 2 patents for their unique combination of naturally occurring blockers of the hair loss process. In addition, one of the naturally occurring ingredients also stimulates Dermal Papillae Cells, the stem cells that initiate the hair growth process. It is the only one of its kind that exists… Because this triple-action, patented, unique formula gives you the absolute highest quality of berry extract, caffeine derivative extract, and EGCG in an all-in-one solution… and in the exact amounts for it to be safe and extremely effective. Dr. Bornstein said “...That’s one of the reasons why we are so passionate about it is that the success of the shampoo and how we’ve helped patients over time is the reason that we recommend it… …The reality is our patented formula with the proprietary ingredients has shown real benefit towards our patients on a routine basis over a long period of time.”</p>

						</div>

					</div>

					<div class="accordion__item">

						<div class="accordion__head"><h3>How Many Bottles Should I Buy?</h3></div>

						<div class="accordion__body">

							<p>For best results we recommend users purchase a 4 month supply of the system. Shapiro MD Shampoo and Conditioner should be used with every shower. Applying to a moist scalp for up to 20 minutes can maximize the benefit. However, many patients have experienced benefits by applying at the beginning of their shower and rinsing at the end of their shower. Showering daily is most effective, but for people who like to shower less often, every other day application is still helpful. </p>

						</div>

					</div>

					<div class="accordion__item">

						<div class="accordion__head"><h3>When will I see results?</h3></div>

						<div class="accordion__body">

							<p>Results can typically be seen in the first month. However, because hair grows slowly, the best benefits can take up to 7 months.</p>

						</div>

					</div>

					<div class="accordion__item">

						<div class="accordion__head"><h3>Why is Shapiro MD better than all other Hair Loss products?</h3></div>

						<div class="accordion__body">

							<p>The Shapiro MD Shampoo Is The Ultimate 3-In-1 Topical Hair Care Aid Shampoo That Provides The Scalp Much Needed Nutrients To Promote New Hair In The Crown And Temple Area. And it’s a specialized triple-action formulation that gives the body the building blocks needed for a healthy scalp… … which is critical to maximizing the retention of existing hair and likelihood of promoting new hair stimulation. Most solutions only address the hair follicles on one site – either just blocking the androgen receptors to help block DHT… Or only stimulating stem cells of hair follicles to help regrowth. We can honestly say that our patented formula inside the Shapiro MD Hair Care Aid shampoo does both, unlike many remedies.</p>

<p>It Not Only Blocks DHT To Help Stop Hair Loss Dead In Its Tracks… But It Stimulates The Stem Cells Of Your Hair Follicles To Help Bring Back Thicker And Fuller Hair!</p>

					<div class="accordion__item">

						<div class="accordion__head"><h3>Who are the Medical Doctors that created this?</h3></div>

						<div class="accordion__body">

							<p>Shapiro MD was originated in January of 2011 by Dermatologists Steven D. Shapiro M.D. and Michael T. Borenstein M.D.Ph.D. after 5 years of previous work on topical DHT (dihidrotestosterone) blockers. They used their background in Clinical Dermatology and patient experience to explore pathways to improving hair. Dr. Shapiro brought 20 years of clinical experience in hair loss and previous hair transplant procedure knowledge to Shaprim MD., Dr. Borenstein brought an intensive scientific background with his PhD in Pharmacology and years of clinical Dermatological experience. Together they have formulated the Shapiro MD Shampoo with three potent naturally occurring DHT blockers in an innovative sulfate free base to be safe and effective in improving hair. Only the best pharmaceutical grade ingredients have been used making this a high quality but cost effective shampoo.</p>

					</div>

					<div class="accordion__item">

						<div class="accordion__head"><h3>Does the Hair Loss Solution work for Women?</h3></div>

						<div class="accordion__body">

							<p>Yes, BUT:</p>

<p>Shapiro MD Shampoo is not recommended for women of childbearing age because of the theoretical risk of active DHT blockers on a potential unborn child. The natural active ingredients are available in coffee, green tea, and saw palmetto berry extract. Despite this, we recommend that women of childbearing potential avoid our product. </p>

				<h3 class="content-title-small">HOW SHAPIRO MD WORKS TO STOP HAIR LOSS & STIMULATE HAIR REGROWTH </h3>

				<h2 class="content-title"><span>The Science Behind </span></h2>

				

 				<div class="behind-step">

 					<div class="behind-step__item">

 						<h3>BLOCKING DHT</h3>

 						<p>Hair loss is typically caused by excess 

						<strong>dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</strong> in the body. 

						Shapiro MD active ingredients target the specific enzyme that converts the male hormone testosterone into <strong>DHT</strong>, effectively halting the main cause of hair loss.</p>

 					</div>

 					<div class="behind-step__item">

 						<h3>STIMULATE NEW GROWTH</h3>

 						<p>Our products are designed to treat hair loss and thinning hair in both men and women.  <strong>DHT</strong> is the main culprit for thinning hair in women.  <strong>Blocking DHT using Shapiro MD’s</strong> advanced formulation is the most reliable way to stop hair loss and regain thicker hair.</p>

 					</div>

 					<div class="behind-step__item">

 						<h3>THICKER, FULLER HAIR</h3>

 						<p>Our Triple Action shampoo and conditioner has helped thousands of men and women achieve life changing thicker and fuller hair.  In addition to powerful <strong>DHT blockers, Shapiro MD’s</strong> products contain essential nutrients for a healthy scalp and hair.</p>

 					</div>

 					<div class="behind-step__item">

 						<h3>INVIGORATE HAIR GROWTH</h3>
