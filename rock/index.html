					<blockquote>
						If you’re like me then you love the guitar. <br><br>
						But improving is tough. There’s mistakes, inconsistency, criticism, slow progress, criticism and not having the right people around you to contend with. And that’s just for starters.<br><br>
						Unless, of course, you’re a rock star. From the outside looking in they appear to progress quickly, play confidently and write original songs effortlessly. Is it because they have a natural advantage, or is there something else going on?<br><br>
						I started to research how the greatest players made it to the top. And it soon became clear that what separates them from other guitarists is their state of mind: their focus, their self-belief, their vision, how they react to setbacks, what they tell themselves, those types of things.<br><br>
						Now, I’ve been studying personal development for over 20 years - and I realized that I have the tools and techniques which, if I adapted them to playing guitar, could install these qualities and create a Rock Star state of mind. <br><br>
						So, that’s exactly what I did! And the result is The Rock Star Method.
						After applying the tools in The Rock Star Method, my own guitar development went into overdrive: I went from messing around at home to being the lead guitarist in a band and playing live around the world. I wrote the songs I’d always wanted to and enjoyed making music like never before.<br><br>
						I took my guitar-playing clients through the process and watched beginners who could barely play a scale lay down killer solos; I saw experienced players overcome nerves to blow audiences away onstage and I saw experts caught in plateaus smash through them to reach new levels of excellence.<br><br>
						Because they had gotten their mind-sets right, they became unstoppable.<br><br>
						And now, you have access to these tools in The Rock Star Method. There's nothing else like it out there - and I guarantee that if you’re serious about achieving your goals with the guitar, then it’s going to be one of the smartest investments you ever make.
